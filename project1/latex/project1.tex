\section{Introduction}

\iffalse
Interesting, cogent account of the work in this report
> in the context of the mathematical problem considered 
> in the scientific computing more widely
Very well referenced.

Talk about the problems we are going to discuss
> Laplacian operator. Finite difference of the finite difference of Laplace
> How do we get the matrix?
> Both for 1 and 2D.

Top 10 algorithms 20th century. How does it relate to wider mathematical community?

\section{Implementation}

\iffalse
Implementation discussion:

Better band storage for wide bands with lots of zeros. Store the nonzeros with their locations.
Better interaction with the program for inputting data or getting results. Use of a scripting language and parser. 
Should treat vectors as matrices, reduces number of classes, fewer bugs and easier implementation.
Sparse matrices
Parallelisation and optimisation.
Unit tests
Error handling
