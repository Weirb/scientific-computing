# Scientific Computing Projects

This repository contains the files for the submissions for the Scientific Computing coursework.


## Project 1 - Conjguate Gradient Method

The conjugate gradient method is implemented in C++, along with a collection classes and helper functions.

To build the project's data and figures, run the following code (requires MATLAB, g++, and make).
Warning: memory intensive. Running this may take some time to run.

```bash
cd project1
make
./cg.exe
make figures
```

## Project 2 - Discontinuous Galerkin Methods

The discontinuous galerkin method is implemented in C++ to solve convection dominated problems.

To build the project's data and figures, run the following code (requires MATLAB, g++, and make).
Warning: memory intensive. Running this may take some time to run.

```
cd project2
make
./galerkin.exe
make figures
```
